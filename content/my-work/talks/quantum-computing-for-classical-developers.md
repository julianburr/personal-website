Quantum computing has been in and out of the news for quite some time now, with promises to break encryption and revolutionise AI, simulations and whole industries. However, for a major part of the public, and even most developers, it remains a bit of a mystery.

Letâ€™s explore it together. What is quantum computing? What sets it apart from classical computing? What are some of the use cases that will transform our world? And, most importantly, what lies ahead in a future where quantum computing becomes accessible to developers of all backgrounds?

This is a passion project of mine. I find quantum mechanics and quantum computing extremely fascinating, so I started diving into how things work and how it might affect our futures. This talk is aiming to share that journey into that fascinating world (from the perspective of a "classical" developer).

I first gave this talk at [DWX Developer Week 2024](https://www.developer-week.de/en/) in Nuremberg, before refining it for [WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2024](https://www.wearedevelopers.com/world-congress/) in Berlin.

Big shoutout to [Muthi](https://www.fiverr.com/muthianwahida), who made the cat illustrations for the current version of the slides ðŸ˜¸
