Quantum computing has been in and out of the news for quite some time now, with promises to break encryption and revolutionise AI, simulations and whole industries. However, for a major part of the public, and even most developers, it remains a bit of a mystery.

Let’s explore it together. What is quantum computing? What sets it apart from classical computing? What are some of the use cases that will transform our world? And, most importantly, what lies ahead in a future where quantum computing becomes accessible to developers of all backgrounds?
