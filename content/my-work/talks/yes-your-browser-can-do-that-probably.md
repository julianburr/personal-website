We’ve become so accustomed to aiming for developing native apps to get access to certain advanced features and functionality that it’s easy to miss that a lot of these have been adopted slowly but surely by our web browsers over time.

In this talk, we'll have a look at some of these Web APIs, how they work, and how you can use them to progressively enhance the experience of your users in a real-life context.

Originally written for [DDD Brisbane](https://www.dddbrisbane.com/) back in 2022, this is an evergreen talk and a favorite of mine. The content keeps evolving with new Web APIs becoming stable and available in modern browsers.
