## Summary

Design shapes decisions, and decisions are influenced by cognitive shortcuts. The book frames bias as a normal human feature that designers can either amplify or help counteract.

### What Is Bias?

Biases are mental shortcuts that help us decide quickly under uncertainty. Understanding their patterns helps designers predict behavior and avoid unintended harm.

### The different biases

- **User bias:** Users bring biases like anchoring, framing effects, and loss aversion to every interaction. Thoughtful design can reduce confusion, support better choices, and avoid dark patterns.
- **Stakeholder bias:** Leaders and stakeholders are also biased, and their decisions shape products. The chapter focuses on surfacing assumptions, reframing conversations, and grounding decisions in evidence.
- **Our own bias:** we are not neutral either, our experiences and incentives shape what we build. The book emphasizes reflection, diverse perspectives, and inclusive processes to counter blind spots.

All in all I think the book does a good job explaining and showcasing the fundamentals on bias, which I think especially for a topic like this is still super important. So don't expect anything ground breaking here, I still highly recommend this book as a starting point.
