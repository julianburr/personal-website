## TL;DR: My personal take-aways

- language and story style is something you have to practise to learn; so practising (aka writing a lot) is key
- create a routine to ensure you're doing that practise
- fluff kills readability; draft with everything that's on your mind, but then revise by removing the fluff and aligning the key story points in your arc; that refinement is also where most of the more detailed research and fact-checking can happen

## Summary

### Read a lot, write a lot

King’s core advice is to read widely to absorb rhythm, voice, and craft, and to write consistently to build skill. Reading is the apprenticeship; writing is the daily practice that turns taste into ability.

### Build a toolbox (vocabulary, grammar, style)

Treat vocabulary, grammar, and style as tools you can reach for without overthinking. Clean mechanics keep the reader immersed and let the story do the work.

**Favor active voice and strong verbs**

Active voice keeps sentences direct and energetic. Strong verbs do more work than padded constructions and keep prose punchy.

**Cut adverbs and weak qualifiers**

Adverbs often signal a weak verb or unclear context, especially in dialogue tags. Replace them with precise verbs or sharper details.

**Keep description concrete and selective**

Start with a clear mental picture, then choose a few vivid details that let readers complete the image. Over-description slows pacing and crowds out imagination.

### Let characters drive the story

Put characters into a situation and let their choices move the plot. Story emerges from what people want and what they do, not from rigid plotting.

### Write the first draft with the door closed

Draft quickly and privately to discover the story without outside noise. Don’t polish while drafting; get the whole thing down first.

**Revise with the door open**

Once the draft exists, bring in feedback and revise for clarity and impact. Revision is where you shape the story for the reader.

### Kill your darlings

Cut passages you love if they don’t serve the story. Sentimentality and self-indulgence are the enemy of pace and clarity.

### Set a routine and protect it

Guard a regular writing time and space, minimize distractions, and set a realistic daily quota. Consistency beats inspiration.

### Write for one ideal reader

Imagine telling the story to one trusted reader to keep your voice focused. It helps avoid generalized, performative prose.

### Research to serve the story

Use research to add authenticity, but don’t let it derail momentum. Story comes first; details are in support.
